    "    Simple linear regression and multiple linear regression are both statistical techniques that use a linear model to predict the value of a dependent variable from one or more independent variables. The main difference between the two is that simple linear regression only has one independent variable, while multiple linear regression has two or more independent variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "        In general, multiple linear regression is more powerful than simple linear regression because it can take into account the effects of multiple independent variables. However, multiple linear regression is also more complex and requires more data to be accurate.\n",

    "\n",
    "    1. Simple linear regression is a special case of multiple linear regression where there is only one independent variable.\n",
    "    2. Multiple linear regression can be used to model nonlinear relationships between the dependent variable and the independent variables, but this requires more complex statistical techniques.\n",
    "    3. Both simple linear regression and multiple linear regression make assumptions about the data, such as the `independent variables are not correlated with each other and the errors are normally distributed`. These assumptions should be checked before using the models to make predictions.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Linearity: \n",
    "    The relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable must be linear. This means that if we plot the data points on a scatter plot, the points should form a straight line.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Homoscedasticity: \n",
    "    The variance of the residuals must be constant across all values of the independent variable(s). This means that the distance of the data points from the regression line should be the same for all values of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Normality: \n",
    "    The residuals must be normally distributed. This means that if we plot the residuals on a histogram, the histogram should be bell-shaped.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Independence: \n",
    "    The residuals must be independent of each other. This means that the value of one residual should not affect the value of another residual.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### No multicollinearity: \n",
    "    The independent variables must not be highly correlated with each other. This means that the independent variables should not be perfectly linearly related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## There are a number of ways to check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset. Here are some common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Plot the data points on a scatter plot. If the points form a straight line, then the linearity assumption is met. If the points do not form a straight line, then the linearity assumption is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Plot the residuals against the predicted values of the dependent variable. If the residuals are randomly scattered around the horizontal line, then the homoscedasticity assumption is met. If the residuals are not randomly scattered, then the homoscedasticity assumption is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a histogram of the residuals. If the histogram is bell-shaped, then the normality assumption is met. If the histogram is not bell-shaped, then the normality assumption is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Run a Durbin-Watson test. The Durbin-Watson test is a statistical test that checks for autocorrelation in the residuals. If the Durbin-Watson test statistic is between 2 and 3, then the autocorrelation assumption is met. If the Durbin-Watson test statistic is less than 2 or greater than 3, then the autocorrelation assumption is not met.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculate the variance inflation factors (VIFs) for the independent variables. The VIFs measure the collinearity between the independent variables. If the VIFs are greater than 10, then there is a high degree of collinearity between the independent variables. This means that the multicollinearity assumption is not met.\n",

The intercept represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is equal to zero.\n",

The slope of the model might be 10,000, which means that for every one-unit increase in square footage, the price of the house increases by $10,000. The intercept of the model might be 200,000, which means that the price of a house with zero square footage is $200,000.\n",

    "    In this real-world scenario, the slope of the model tells us that there is a positive linear relationship between the square footage of a house and its price. This means that the price of a house tends to increase as the square footage of the house increases. The intercept of the model tells us that the price of a house with zero square footage is $200,000. This is likely because the cost of building a house, even a very small house, is still significant.\n",

    "# Q5. Multiple Linear Regression vs. Simple Linear Regression:**\n",
    "Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear Regression that allows for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In simple linear regression, you have one independent variable predicting a dependent variable, while in multiple linear regression, you have two or more independent variables predicting the same dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- y is the dependent variable.\n",
    "- x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are the independent variables.\n",
    "- β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ are the regression coefficients associated with each independent variable.\n",
    "- ε represents the error term.\n",

    "# Q6. Multicollinearity in Multiple Linear Regression:**\n",
    "Multicollinearity refers to a situation in multiple linear regression where two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. This can cause issues because it becomes challenging to distinguish the individual effects of the correlated variables on the dependent variable. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detection and Addressing of Multicollinearity:**\n",
    "- **Detection:** Multicollinearity can be detected using correlation matrices or variance inflation factors (VIFs). VIFs measure how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient is increased due to multicollinearity.\n",
    "- **Addressing:** To address multicollinearity, you can:\n",
    "  - Remove one of the correlated variables if they are redundant.\n",
    "  - Combine the correlated variables into a single composite variable.\n",
    "  - Regularize the model using techniques like Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression, which can help mitigate the effects of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. Polynomial Regression vs. Linear Regression:**\n",
    "Polynomial Regression is an extension of Linear Regression where the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial. In polynomial regression, the model can capture nonlinear relationships between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a polynomial regression model of degree 2 can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "y = β₀ + β₁x + β₂x² + ε\n",

    "The key difference is that while linear regression fits a straight line to the data, polynomial regression can fit curves to better capture complex relationships.\n",

    "# Q8. Advantages and Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression:**\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Polynomial regression can capture nonlinear relationships that linear regression cannot.\n",
    "- **Better Fit:** It can provide a better fit for data that exhibits curvature or nonlinearity.\n",
    "- **Versatility:** Can be used when other methods fail to model the data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** High-degree polynomials can lead to overfitting, where the model fits the noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern.\n",
    "- **Increased Complexity:** Higher-degree polynomials introduce more parameters, making the model more complex and harder to interpret.\n",
    "- **Extrapolation Issues:** Polynomial models can give unreliable predictions beyond the range of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Polynomial Regression:**\n",
    "Polynomial regression is useful when you suspect that the relationship between the variables is nonlinear and cannot be effectively captured by a linear model. It's essential to carefully choose the degree of the polynomial to balance model complexity and overfitting. If a linear relationship is sufficient to explain the data, then linear regression is often preferable due to its simplicity and interpretability."
