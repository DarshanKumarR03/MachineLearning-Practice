    "\n",
    "1. **Visualizing Training and Validation Curves**: Plotting the model's performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, loss) on both the training and validation datasets over epochs during training can provide insights into overfitting or underfitting. Overfitting is indicated when the training performance continues to improve while the validation performance plateaus or degrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cross-Validation**: Using k-fold cross-validation helps evaluate the model's performance on multiple data splits, giving a better estimate of its generalization capabilities. If the model's performance varies significantly across different folds, it might be an indication of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hold-Out Validation Set**: Setting aside a separate validation set from the training data can help measure the model's performance on unseen data. If the model performs significantly worse on the validation set compared to the training set, it might be overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Learning Curves**: Plotting the training and validation performance against the size of the training data can provide insights into underfitting or overfitting. An underfit model will exhibit poor performance on both training and validation data, while an overfit model will show a large gap between the two curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Regularization Effects**: If using regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, check the effect on the model's performance. Properly tuned regularization can help control overfitting.\n",

    "7. **Comparison with Baselines**: Comparing the model's performance with simple baselines (e.g., using a constant value or basic rules) can help identify if the model is underfitting or not learning the data's patterns.\n",

    "8. **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: In classification problems, analyzing the confusion matrix can provide insights into which classes the model is struggling to predict accurately, indicating potential underfitting or overfitting issues.\n",
